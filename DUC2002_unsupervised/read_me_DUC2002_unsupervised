The output summaries for DUC 2002 using an unsupervised approach are located in "experiments_DUC2002_unsup.zip" folder, these output summaries were used for java library and (the finally results are in the "java_library_DUC2002_unsupervised.xlsx" and each output file (.csv) are located in "evaluation30_duc2002_unsupervised_java_library.rar"), pyrouge (the finally results are in the "pyrouge_library_duc2002_unsupervised.xlsx" and each output file (.npy) are located in "experiments_DUC2002_unsup_pyrouge.zip") and easy-rouge libraries, "summaries_for_ROUGE_pltrdy_A_DUC2002.rar" and "summaries_for_ROUGE_pltrdy_B_DUC2002.rar" folders contain the output summaries for rouge library. In this particular case, the unsupervised approach has a code segment which depends of randomness, so I ran the experiment 30 times and the output was the average result of the 30 experiments.

In the following table the results are shown.

| ROUGE library | Java | Easy-rouge | Rouge | Pyrouge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROUGE-1 recall | 0.5279 | 0.4645 | 0.0859 | 0.3064 |
| ROUGE-1 precision | 0.2981 | 0.2856 | 0.1091 | 0.1850 |
| ROUGE-1 F score | 0.3754 | 0.2856 | 0.0874 | 0.2263 |
| ROUGE-2 recall | 0.2146 | 0.1592 | 0.0498 | 0.0289 |
| ROUGE-2 precision | 0.1219 | 0.0954 | 0.0614 | 0.0171 |
| ROUGE-2 F score | 0.1523 | 0.0954 | 0.0500 | 0.0211 |

"DUC2002_unsupervised_A.rar" and "DUC2002_unsupervised_B.rar" folders have the gold standards of DUC 2002 unsupervised experiments.

The notebooks (.ipynb files) contains the python implementations (easy-rouge and rouge python, both run in colab) and in their cell output we can observe the ROUGE metric.

The "model..." folders are the gold standards for each experiment.
