The folder "simple_toy_examples" contains two documents to summarize and one gold standard. The first document has three sentences, the second has four sentences and the gold standard has four sentences. 

Document D1:

S1: Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announcing Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup.

S2: The camera zooms in on the impassive faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.

S3: What is going on here? OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies.

Document D2:

S1: Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea, where he was vacationing at the time of Monday's coup, for the two-hour flight to Moscow, said a deputy to Russian Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets.

S2: Earlier reports that the plane had already taken off were incorrect, officials said.

S3: The Soviet leader, in a statement for radio and television, said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear "full responsibility" for their actions.

S4: In the United States, President Bush hailed Gorbachev's return to power and said the coup leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings."

For this example I create four output summaries (located in "toy_example2_d1", "toy_example2_d2", "toy_example2_d3". "toy_example2_d4" folders), which contains the following:

A. The sentences from Document 1

B. The sentences from Document 2

C. The last two sentences from Document 1 and the third sentence of Document 2

D. The sentences of both documents

The notebooks (.ipynb files) contains the python implementations (easy-rouge and rouge python, both run in colab) and in their cell output we can observe the ROUGE metric.

The ROUGE metric for each output summary is contained in numpy files (.npy) named r1_recall_toy_example2_duc2002_d1_easyrouge, r1_precision_toy_example2_duc2002_d1_easyrouge, r1_f1_score_toy_example2_duc2002d1_easyrouge and so on for each pyrouge library result in each document (d1-d4).

The output files from java ROUGE 2.0 are comma separated files (.csv).
