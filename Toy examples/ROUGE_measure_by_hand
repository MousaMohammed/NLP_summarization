In this example we have the example of "very simple toy examples":

Output Document 1:

S1: Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail.

S2: Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev.

S3: Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin.

Gold Standard Document 1:

S1: Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail Mikhail.

S2: Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev.

S3: Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin Yeltsin.

In order to measure n-grams we do the following:

* For unigrams (1-grams) we only count words.

* For bigrams (2-grams) we count windows of two words with no overlapping between the windows. 

In the example above Mikhail-Mikhail is a bigram (first and second words of S1 in Output Document 1), then we skip the next two words and form the next bigram, which is Mikhail-Mikhail (third and fourth words of S1 in Output Document 1). When we skip two words we called no-overlapped bigrams.

On the one hand, for Output Document 1 we have the following: 

* S1 has 20 words length (20 unigrams and 10 bigrams)

* S2 has 9 words length (9 unigrams and 4 bigrams)

* S3 has 16 words length (16 unigrams and 8 bigrams)

On the other hand, for Gold Standard Document 1 we have the following:

* S1 has 8 words length (8 unigrams and 4 bigrams)

* S2 has 9 words length (9 unigrams and 4 bigrams)

* S3 has 16 words length (16 unigrams and 8 bigrams)

The vocabulary has a length of three, it means in all texts there are three different words.


We calculate the following equations in order to obtain the ROUGE measure by hand:

                 number of n-grams co-ocurring between the Gold Standard Document and the Output Document
ROUGE-n recall = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   number of n-grams in the Gold Standard Document                                 (1)
                                   
                    number of n-grams co-ocurring between the Gold Standard Document and the Output Document
ROUGE-n precision = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   number of n-grams in the Output Document                                        (2) 

                       ROUGE-n recall · ROUGE-n precision
ROUGE-n F1 score = 2 · ----------------------------------
                       ROUGE-n recall + ROUGE-n precision
                       

For ROUGE-1, we have n = 1, it means that we have to count unigrams, and substituting in Equation 1 and 2, we obtain the following:

                  33
ROUGE-1 recall = ---- = 1
                  33
                  
                     32
ROUGE-1 precision = ---- = 0.7333
                     45

                        1 · 0.7333
ROUGE-1 F1 score = 2 · ------------ = 0.8461
                        1 + 0.7333
                        
For ROUGE-2, we have n = 2, it means that we have to count bigrams, and substituting in Equation 1 and 2, we obtain the following:

                  16
ROUGE-2 recall = ---- = 1
                  16
                  
                     16
ROUGE-2 precision = ---- = 0.7273
                     22

                        1 · 0.7273
ROUGE-2 F1 score = 2 · ------------ = 0.8421
                        1 + 0.7273
