Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announcing Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup.
The camera zooms in on the impassive faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.
What is going on here? OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies.
Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea, where he was vacationing at the time of Monday's coup, for the two-hour flight to Moscow, said a deputy to Russian Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets.
Earlier reports that the plane had already taken off were incorrect, officials said.
The Soviet leader, in a statement for radio and television, said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear "full responsibility" for their actions.
In the United States, President Bush hailed Gorbachev's return to power and said the coup leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings."
